# Photo to Tactile Image Converter
This is a collaborative project between MLT (Suzana Ilic, John Lau) and Prof. Tune Kamae, a former physics professor (University of Tokyo, Stanford University) who has been engaged for years in supporting, teaching and creating learning resources for visually impaired and blind people. MLT is supporting his efforts.

The goal of this project is to convert photo to [Tactile Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_graphic) that can be printed with Tactile Printer on Swell Paper to assist visually impaired person in seeing the photo.

This project is done as part of the [Machine Learning Tokyo](mltokyo.ai) activities **AI for Social Good**. Currently we have built a simple prototype that will get deployed as a web application as the next step.

## Example: Input image and output patterns

## After thermo-printing
Blind people are testing the tactile patterns representing the original image.
